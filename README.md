# Fixera Server

Express + TypeScript API for authentication, user verification (email + phone OTP), and basic user endpoints.

### Stack
- Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT (cookie-based auth)
- Brevo (Sendinblue) for email OTP
- Twilio Verify for SMS OTP

## Quick Start

1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Create a .env file
```env
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=change_me

# Email (Brevo)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@your-domain.com

# SMS (Twilio Verify)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=VAXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

3) Run the server (traditional long-lived process)
```bash
npm run build && npm start
# or for dev with ts-node/ts-node-dev if configured
npm run dev
```

The server connects to MongoDB once at startup, then listens on `PORT` (default 4000).

## Architecture & Key Decisions

- Single DB connection at startup (no per-request connection middleware).
- Cookie-based auth with httpOnly cookie `auth-token`.
- CORS allows credentials and reflects the request origin.
- Signup triggers both OTP sends directly on the backend (no extra client round trips).
- Verification endpoints can be protected or public per your preference; by default they are protected via `protect` middleware.

## CORS & Cookies

- CORS: credentials enabled; origin is reflected.
- Cookies: `SameSite` is set to `none` in production and `secure` depends on `NODE_ENV === 'production'`.
- If you’re testing cross-site in production, ensure HTTPS so `secure` cookies work.

## Routes

Base path: `/api`

### Auth
- POST `/auth/signup`
  - Body: `{ name, email, phone, password, role }`
  - Creates user, generates JWT cookie, sends email OTP (Brevo) and SMS OTP (Twilio Verify).
  - Response: `{ success, user, emailOtpSent, phoneOtpSent }`

- POST `/auth/login`
  - Body: `{ email, password }`
  - Sets `auth-token` cookie on success.

- POST `/auth/logout`
  - Clears `auth-token` cookie.

- GET `/auth/me`
  - Returns `{ authenticated: true, user }` if cookie is valid; otherwise `{ authenticated: false }`.
  - Always 200 to avoid front-end exceptions on first load.

### User
- All user routes are mounted at `/user`.
- Middleware: `protect` is applied globally to `user` routes by default, meaning a valid `auth-token` is required.

- GET `/user/me` (protected)
  - Returns current user without password.

- POST `/user/verify-email/send-otp` (protected)
  - Sends email OTP (10 min expiry). Idempotent until verified.

- POST `/user/verify-email/verify-otp` (protected)
  - Verifies email OTP and marks `isEmailVerified=true`.

- POST `/user/verify-email/resend-otp` (protected)
  - Generates and sends a new email OTP.

- POST `/user/verify-phone` (protected)
  - Sends SMS OTP via Twilio Verify to `phone`.

- POST `/user/verify-phone-check` (protected)
  - Verifies the phone OTP with Twilio Verify and marks `isPhoneVerified=true` on success.

## Middleware

### `protect`
- Reads `auth-token` from cookies.
- Validates JWT, fetches user, attaches `req.user`.
- Returns 401 for missing/invalid/expired tokens.

## Error Handling

- Centralized error handler returns JSON: `{ message, stack (in dev) }`.
- Auth and verification handlers return clear `success`/`msg` or `message` fields.

## Common Issues & Tips

- CORS with credentials:
  - Ensure the frontend fetch uses `credentials: 'include'`.
  - In production, cookies require HTTPS for `secure: true`.

- OTP deliverability:
  - Check Brevo/Twilio credentials.
  - Email may land in spam; SMS may be rate-limited.

- JWT secrets:
  - Use a strong `JWT_SECRET` and rotate if needed.

## Development Notes

- Logs: only essential error logs are kept by default.
- You can add more structured logging if needed (e.g., pino/winston) without changing the flow.
